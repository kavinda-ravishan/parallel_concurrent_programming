Divide and conquer
------------------

1. Divide the problem into subproblems.
2. Conquer the subproblems by solving them recursively.
3. Combine the solutions to the subproblems.


Algorithm

* if "base case"
    -> solve problem.

* else
    -> partition problem into "left" and "right" subproblems.
    -> solve "left" problem using divide-and-conquer.
    -> solve "right" problem using divide-and-conquer.
