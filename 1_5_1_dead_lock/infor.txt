Dead lock

Ex : 
1.
Try to lock a mutex that already lock (by the same thread) and it will enter into the waiting list for that mutex.
this result the dead lock because no other thread can unlock that mutex.

Reentrant mutex (Recursive Lock)
Can lock multiple time and need to unlock same number of times for unlock the lock.

2.
If for use the resource thread need unlock two locks but two threads unlocks each lock and wait for other lock.

Prioritize the lock (both threads compete to take prioritize lock first)
Scoped_lock have built-in dead lock avoiding algorithm
