Shared and Distributed memory 
|
|___Shared memory (KEY : all processors can see what happening in the shared memory)
|    |___UMA  : Uniform memory access (each processor can access memory equally fast)
|    |   |____SMP : symmetric multi-processing (architecture Modern processors commonly use with cash (issue: case coherency))
|    |
|    |___NUMA : Non-uniform memory access (Mostly by connecting multiple SMP systems through a system bus)
|
|___Distributed memory (KEY : Each processor has it’s own local memory with it’s own address space)
