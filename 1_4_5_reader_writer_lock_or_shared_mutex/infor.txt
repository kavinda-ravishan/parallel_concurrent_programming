Reader writer lock or shared mutex

Use:
Multiple threads can read form same memory without issue but only one thread should read from it 
and this can achieved by shared mutex.

shared mutex have two locking modes.

1. shared read mode - lock and multiple threads can read at same time
2. exclusive write mode - only one thread can lock and write (other threads cannot read as well)
