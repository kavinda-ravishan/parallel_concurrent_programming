Race conditon

Flor in the timing or ordering of the programâ€™s execution that causes incorrect behaviors.

Ex : 

Correct flow:
x = 10 --->  x = x + 3 ---->  x = x * 2 ---> x = 26


Incorrect flow:

t1 start      t1                                    t1 join
__________ x = x * 2__________________________________
       |              |                               |
x = 10 -------------> x = 20 --------------> x = 23---|---> x = 23
                              |              |        |
______________________________|___ x = x + 3_|________|
t2 start                               t2            t2 join


Hard to find the issue because order can change run to run.
