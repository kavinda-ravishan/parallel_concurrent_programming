Ex:

Sequential program take 25 seconds and parallel version with 2 processors take 17 seconds

          (25 seconds)
Speedup = ------------  =  1.47
          (17 seconds)

                  speedup            (1.47)
Efficiency =  ----------------- =    ------ = 73.5%
              (# of processors)         2
