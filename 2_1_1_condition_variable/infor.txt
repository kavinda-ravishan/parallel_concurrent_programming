condition variable
-------------------

Act as a queue or waiting room for threads for a certain condition
(Place for threads to wait until notified)

condition variable associate with mutex and they work together for implement a higher-level construct call monitor.

Monitor
-------
Monitors protect critical sections of code using mutual exclusion and they provide,
1. Mechanism for threads for wait or block until a certain condition occurs
2. Mechanism for signal those waiting threads when their conditions are met


condition variable's three main operations
------------------------------------------

Wait:
Release the lock on the mutex.
Go to sleep and enter waiting queue.
Reacquire lock when woken up.

Signal:
Wake up one thread from condition variable queue.
(Also called notify or wake)

Broadcast:
Wake up all threads from condition variable queue.
(Also called notify all or wake all)
