Semaphore (counting semaphore)
----------

Synchronization mechanism that can used to control access to shared resources.

1.
Unlike mutex semaphore can allow multiple threads to access the resource at the same time 
and it has a counter to track how many times itâ€™s been acquired or released.

2.
if counter is positive any thread can acquire the semaphore which then decrement that counter value

3.
if counter reaches zero then threads trying to acquire the semaphore will be blocked 
and place in the queue to wait until it's available.

4.
When thread is done using the resource it will release the semaphore which increment the counter value 
and if there any waiting threads they will be signaled to wake up.


Mutex vs. semaphore
--------------------

Mutex
Can only acquire/released by the same thread

semaphore
Can be acquire and released by different threads
(any thread can acquire the semaphore and decrement the counter value or
any thread can release the semaphore and increment the counter value)
